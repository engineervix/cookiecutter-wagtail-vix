## Features ‚ú®

- An opinionated starting point for a CMS-based website project, with so many batteries included:
  - a homepage and "About" section, which includes addition of key personnel (with position, bio, social profiles, etc.)
  - a minimal functional blog with simplified categories and tags,
  - a contact page with contact form and location map. Includes SMS support powered by [Vonage](https://www.vonage.com/) (formerly _Nexmo_)
- Tests written using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) in conjunction with [pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (plus other pytest plugins), [factory_boy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [wagtail-factories](https://github.com/mvantellingen/wagtail-factories). Test coverage currently stands at about 85%.
- Custom [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) Compilation using Sass.
- [Font Awesome 5 (free)](https://fontawesome.com/icons?m=free) icons.
- [shufflejs](https://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/) ‚Äî Categorize, sort, and filter a responsive grid of items
- Live reload courtesy of [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/).
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) based workflow, with defined tasks for:
  - copying minified (dist) files of modules listed in package.json "dependencies" field to the `static/vendors` directory,
  - deleting files and directories in the `static/vendors` directory,
  - transpiling ES6 code to ES5 using [babel](https://babeljs.io/), and _uglifying_ the resulting JS files,
  - compiling SCSS to CSS and _minifying_ css files
  - _watching_ for file changes (in conjunction with BrowserSync)
- [django-environ](https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ) ‚Äî allows you to utilize 12factor inspired environment variables to configure your Django application.
- [django-extensions](https://github.com/django-extensions/django-extensions) ‚Äî global custom management extensions for the Django Framework. I especially like [`runserver_plus`](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runserver_plus.html) (the standard runserver stuff but with the Werkzeug debugger baked in) and [`shell_plus`](https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shell_plus.html) (Django shell with autoloading of the apps database models and subclasses of user-defined classes).
- [django-recaptcha](https://github.com/praekelt/django-recaptcha)
- [django-debug-toolbar](https://github.com/jazzband/django-debug-toolbar) for use during development
- [django-maintenancemode-2](https://github.com/alsoicode/django-maintenancemode-2) ‚Äî makes it easy to put your Django site into "maintenance mode", or more technically, return an HTTP 503 response. This project differs slightly from other implementations in that the maintenance mode flag is stored in your database versus settings or an environment variable. If your site is deployed to multiple servers, the centralized database-based maintenance flag makes it a snap to bring them all up or down at once.
- Automatic dependency management via [Renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate)
- Task execution and automation using [`invoke`](http://www.pyinvoke.org/).
- Linting using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) ready
- Documentation on setting up the project (This README and the generated project's README!)
- A ready to use VSCode configuration, just update the path to your python executable in the generated `.vscode/settings.json`.
- The project comes with three Continuous Integration configurations (Simply choose one of the three and delete the others. If you don't like any of these three, feel free to use other options such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), etc.):
  - [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/).
  - [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/),
  - [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

## Dev Setup üíª

### First things first

- A [\*nix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) environment is highly recommended. Although you can possibly develop on Windows too (if you do, and you're using Powershell or CMD, you'll probably have to adapt some commands to suit a Windows Environment, because these docs assume you're running in a \*nix environment)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with the following packages installed **globally**:
  - [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently): `npm install -g concurrently`
  - [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/): `npm install -g browser-sync`
  - [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/): `npm install -g gulp-cli`
  - [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/): `npm install commitizen -g`
  - [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/): `npm install prettier -g`
  - [Sass](https://sass-lang.com): `npm install -g sass`
  - [MailDev](https://github.com/maildev/maildev): `npm install -g maildev`
  - [DocToc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc): `npm install -g doctoc`
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): See [installation instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable)
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) (3.6 and above) with [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools).
- The project uses the [PostgreSQL Backend](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/topics/search/backends.html#postgresql-backend) for the wagtail search interface. Therefore, please ensure that Postgres (or PostGIS) are setup on your machine.

### Getting Started

1. ensure that you have [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) installed on your computer
2. run `cookiecutter https://github.com/engineervix/cookiecutter-wagtail-vix.git` in your favourite shell. You‚Äôll be prompted for some values, such as **project_name**, , **project_slug**, **email**, **wagtail_user_email** etc. A new wagtail project will be created in a folder named according to the **project_slug** at your current location.
3. create a virtual environment for your project and and `pip install --upgrade pip`. Thereafter, `cd` into the project folder created above and install python dependencies: First, install [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools): `pip install pip-tools`, then run `pip-compile requirements.in` followed by `pip-sync`.
4. Now would be a good time to setup your postgres/postgis database and ensure that you update `DATABASE_URL` and the other environment variables in your `.env` files. The essential ones for starters are `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY`, `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY` and `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
5. `export ENV_PATH=.envs/.dev.env`
6. `./manage.py makemigrations` followed by `./manage.py migrate`
7. `./manage.py createsuperuser`. When prompted for an email address, please use the **wagtail_user_email** you specified in step 2. This is important to ensure that you don't have issues when populating the database with initial data, which is tied to the email address provided in step 2.
8. `./manage.py load_initial_data`
9. `yarn`
10. `gulp cp`
11. Prior to running tests, check `package.json` to ensure that you have the correct postgres/postgis settings. Once you're all set, go ahead and run tests: `yarn test`.
12. Start the development server: `yarn dev`. Your site should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` or `http://localhost:3000`.

### Other Steps

- setup version control (git) for your generated project
- setup [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):
  1. `pre-commit install`
  2. `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`
  3. `pre-commit run --all-files`

> :exclamation: If you are using pyenv, see <https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/810>. In particular, I found [this explanation](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/810#issuecomment-424732161) from @thomasfowler and [this comment](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/810#issuecomment-602770714) from @asottile to be very helpful.

### git Workflow

0. :warning: First, ensure that, before you make any changes, you have pulled the latest changes from remote.
1. Add the file(s) you wanna commit: `git add whatever`
2. `git commit` -- this will run [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/); you'll be prompted to fill in any required fields and your commit messages will be formatted according to [cz-conventional-changelog](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-conventional-changelog) &ndash; a Commitizen adapter which prompts for [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) standard.
3. If there are no issues, push your changes accordingly, otherwise, repeat steps 1 and 2 above until all issues are resolved.

> :exclamation: If you encounter `stylelint` errors, you  might wanna run `yarn css-fix` to try and fix such errors. This is likely to happen on first commit!

> :exclamation: If you make any changes to the structure of your README.md or other markdown files, do `yarn toc` before committing, so that the TOC is updated

### Python Code Formatting

- Run `invoke lint` to run [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) on the code.
- If you get any errors from `black` and/or `isort`, run `invoke lint --fix` or `invoke lint -f` so that black and isort can format your files. If this still doesn't work, don't worry, there's a bunch of pre-commit hooks that that have been set up to deal with this. Take a look at [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml).

## TODO ‚úÖ

### Automation

- [ ] Automate Steps 1 to 10 by adding these in the `post_gen_project` hook or incorporating them in invoke's `tasks.py`

### Testing and Code Quality

- [ ] Improve test coverage for the generated wagtail project
- [ ] Setup integrated tests / e2e tests (Cypress / Selenium ?)
- [ ] Improve on code style (*This is already in progress*)

### CI/CD / Production

- [ ] Add docker support
- [ ] Improve the CI/CD pipelines for the generated wagtail project, to handle automatic deployments

### Project Features

- [ ] Generate RSS Feeds from Blog
- [ ] Add custom `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`

### Done

- [X] ~~Make the `Makefile` functional~~ I've removed the `Makefile` and [replaced it with *invoke*](https://importthis.tech/task-execution-and-automation-using-invoke).
- [X] Write tests and setup CI for this cookiecutter package
- [X] Possibly add support for other popular CI options (added CircleCI and GitHub Actions)
- [X] Add `Gulp` support (No longer using `Grunt`)
- [X] Add some more [badges](https://shields.io/) if need be :wink:
- [X] Add better production-level features to make it easy to move from development to production (serving static assets, mail, caching, performance, task queues, Nginx and uWsgi/Gunicorn configuration, etc.) (*This is always a work in progress, will continue updating as necessary*)

### Deprecated

- [X] ~~Add support for different Databases right from the beginning~~. Even though this cookiecuter generates an SQLite `DATABASE_URL` for you, some of the generated project's features (like **search**) depend on using Postgres, so you should use Postgres/PostGIS.
- [X] ~~The cookiecutter prompt asks if you wanna use bootswatch themes. If you say "n", it shouldn't prompt you with another question on which bootswatch theme to use! See [this](https://github.com/polyswarm/participant-template/issues/2) and [that](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/issues/913)~~. Since we're customizing bootstrap using Sass, no need to use bootswatch.

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions, issues and feature requests are most welcome! A good place to start is by helping out with the unchecked items in the [TODO](#todo-) section above!

Feel free to check the [issues page](https://github.com/engineervix/cookiecutter-wagtail-vix/issues) and take a look at the [contributing guide](https://github.com/engineervix/cookiecutter-wagtail-vix/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you get started. In addition, please note the following:

- if you're making code contributions, please try and write some tests to accompany your code, and ensure that the tests pass. Also, where necessary, update the docs so that they reflect your changes.
- commit your changes via `cz commit`. Follow the prompts. When you're done, `pre-commit` will be invoked to ensure that your contributions and commits follow defined conventions. See `pre-commit-config.yaml` for more details.
- your commit messages should follow the conventions described [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like `git merge` and `git revert`.
Once you are done, please create a [pull request](https://github.com/engineervix/cookiecutter-wagtail-vix/pulls).
