# Development Setup

The development setup is outlined in the project's **README**. In keeping things [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), we will not reproduce the README contents here.

It's important to note that, as a minimum you'll need to have both [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine.

If you are reading these docs, then we can assume that you have access to the project's git repository, and have already cloned it (or forked and cloned your fork). Please see the **README** for details of how to setup the project on your machine.
