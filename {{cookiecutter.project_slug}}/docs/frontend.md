# Frontend tooling

## What's required

To install Node.js on the host machine you could use tools like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), [`volta`](https://volta.sh/) and so on. Once you have Node.js 22 installed simply run `npm install` in the project root to install the dependencies.

## Starting afresh

The _{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}_ frontend tooling is versioned via `package.json`, and the `package-lock.json` lockfile pins all of the project’s direct and transitive dependencies. If you wish to start the project with up to date dependencies without doing manual upgrades, you can discard the lockfile and re-create it:

```sh
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

Remember to then commit the updated `package-lock.json`.

## What's included

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with [auto-prefixing](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
- [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) for live reloading.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for module bundling.
  - With `babel-loader` to process JavaScript.
  - With `css-loader`, `postcss-loader`, and `sass-loader` to process stylesheets.
- Consideration for images, currently copying the directory only - to avoid slowdowns and non-essential dependencies. It is recommended to use SVG for UI vectors and pre-optimised UI photograph assets.
- [Build commands](#build-scripts) for generating testable or deployable assets only
- CSS linting with `stylelint`
- JS linting with `eslint`
- Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Development

- The development environment is executed via:

  ```bash
  npm run dev:reload # (1)!
  ```

  1. Note that this is automatically executed when you run `inv start` in the `web` container. For details, see `docker/Procfile`.

- Source files for developing your project are in `assets` and the distribution folder for the compiled assets is `static`. Don't make direct changes to the `static` directory as they will be overwritten.

## Deployment

### Build scripts

To only build assets for either development or production you can use

- `npm run build` To build development assets
- `npm run build:prod` To build assets with minification and vendor prefixes
